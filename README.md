# Play-The-Chord

A simple flash-card like app that presents you with a random chord name for you to try and play. **Some form of MIDI input is required.** Correctly pressed keys turn green; incorrectly pressed, red. A new random chord will be prompted when you correctly play the currently prompted chord. There are root letter, root accidental, and chord quality options for setting what chords to include in the set. Feel free to [support](https://ko-fi.com/gregorypotter), if you'd like to see this expanded with more features.

This was inspired by this BlueSky post from Freya Holmér:

This is a neat article that I referenced for making the keyboard graphic's dimensions:

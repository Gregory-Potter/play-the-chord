# Play-The-Chord

A simple flash-card like app that presents you with a random chord name for you to try and play. **Some form of MIDI input is required.** Correctly pressed keys turn green; incorrectly pressed, red. Feel free to [support](https://ko-fi.com/gregorypotter), if you'd like to see this expanded with more features.
